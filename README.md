# hello-world
My first github project! I created this by following the github.com tutorial here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
My name is Mike and I am an aspiring software developer. I like the challenge of finding solutions and new approaches to old and new problems; software development is an awesome pursuit and tool.
